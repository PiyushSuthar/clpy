# Clpy ðŸ“‹

Save copied image from clipboard as an image file directly from your command line!

#### Note

It works only on windows as of now. I'll be adding support for other platforms soon!

## Usage

Download `clpy.exe` from release page and save it somewhere.

Next add that path to your Path environment variable.

Now you can use it as a command line tool.

    clpy [file_name]

It has only one argument, `file_name`, which is the name of the image file you want to save.

The name should be without a `.png` extension.

The argument is optional. If you don't specify it, it will save the image from clipboard as `clpy_image.png`.
